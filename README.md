# Graphql-Server
This is a simple implementation of a GraphQL server

## Setup

Running a simple `npm i` will install everything to let you work on the environment.

```bash
npm i
```
## Start Server
The server is listening on port 4000 as soon as its started successfully. 
To watch the queries and its results, run https://studio.apollographql.com/sandbox/explorer in Chrome Browser.
The Explorer acts like a REST Client (e.g. Postman). 

```bash
npm run start
```

### In Watchmode
```bash
npm run start:watch
```
